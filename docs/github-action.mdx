# GitHub Action

Run beads-workflows in GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD integration.

## Quick Setup

Create `.github/workflows/beads-workflows.yml`:

```yaml
name: beads-workflows

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['.beads/issues.jsonl']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'   # hourly
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'   # daily
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'   # weekly
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      retry_failed:
        type: boolean
        description: 'Retry all failed workflows'

jobs:
  run-workflows:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2

      - run: bun add beads-workflows

      - name: Get previous issues.jsonl
        if: github.event_name == 'push'
        run: |
          git show HEAD~1:.beads/issues.jsonl > /tmp/before.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "" > /tmp/before.jsonl

      - name: Run workflows
        run: |
          if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" == "workflow_dispatch" ] && [ "${{ inputs.retry_failed }}" == "true" ]; then
            bunx beads-workflows retry --all-failed
          else
            bunx beads-workflows run --once
          fi

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add .beads/workflows.jsonl
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "chore: update workflows.jsonl"
          git push
```

## Triggers

### Push

Runs when `issues.jsonl` changes on main:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['.beads/issues.jsonl']
```

The action compares `HEAD~1` with `HEAD` to detect:
- Created issues
- Updated issues
- Closed issues

### Schedule

Runs on a cron schedule:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'   # Runs every.hour.ts
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'   # Runs every.day.ts
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'   # Runs every.week.ts
```

The cron expression is passed to handlers via `github.event.schedule`.

### Manual

Trigger manually from GitHub UI:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      retry_failed:
        type: boolean
        description: 'Retry all failed workflows'
```

## Change Detection

For push events, the action detects changes by comparing commits:

```bash
# Get previous state
git show HEAD~1:.beads/issues.jsonl > /tmp/before.jsonl

# Run with diff detection
bunx beads-workflows run --once
```

The `diff()` function compares states and triggers appropriate handlers.

## Execution Tracking

All executions are logged to `workflows.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"type":"issue","issue":"bw-123","event":"created","status":"success","handler":"on.issue.created.ts","triggered_at":"2025-01-01T10:00:00Z","duration":142,"commit":"abc123","trigger":"push"}
```

This file is committed and pushed, providing:
- Audit trail
- Idempotency (prevents duplicate runs)
- Retry information

## Failure Handling

When a handler fails:

1. Error is logged to `workflows.jsonl`
2. Other handlers continue executing
3. Failed handlers can be retried manually

### Retry Failed

From GitHub Actions UI:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "beads-workflows"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check "Retry all failed workflows"
5. Click "Run workflow"

Or via CLI:
```bash
beads-workflows retry --all-failed
```

## Handler Permissions

Handlers have full access to:
- Read/write issues and epics
- Execute `bd` CLI commands
- Access environment variables
- Make network requests

Changes made by handlers are committed along with `workflows.jsonl`.

## Environment Variables

Available in handlers:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_EVENT` | Trigger type (push, schedule, workflow_dispatch) |
| `GITHUB_SCHEDULE` | Cron expression (for schedule triggers) |
| `GITHUB_SHA` | Current commit SHA |
| `GITHUB_REF` | Current ref (branch/tag) |

## Tips

### Prevent Infinite Loops

If handlers modify `issues.jsonl`, add a condition:

```yaml
- name: Run workflows
  if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'
  run: bunx beads-workflows run --once
```

### Custom Schedules

Add more cron triggers for custom `every()` handlers:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'     # hourly
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # every 15 min
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1-5'   # 9am weekdays
```

### Secrets

Pass secrets to handlers:

```yaml
- name: Run workflows
  run: bunx beads-workflows run --once
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```
