# beads-workflows

Workflow engine and TypeScript SDK for the [beads](https://github.com/beads-ai/beads) issue tracker. Build automated workflows that react to issue changes, run on schedules, and execute in GitHub Actions or as a local daemon.

## Installation

```bash
bun add beads-workflows
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Beads } from 'beads-workflows'

const beads = await Beads()

// List ready issues (no blockers)
const ready = await beads.issues.ready()

// Create an issue
await beads.issues.create({
  title: 'Implement feature X',
  type: 'feature',
  priority: 2,
})

// Close when done
await beads.issues.close('bw-123')
```

## Key Concepts

### Issues & Epics

The SDK provides full read/write access to beads issues and epics:

- **Issues**: Tasks, bugs, features with status, priority, dependencies
- **Epics**: Groups of related issues with progress tracking

### Event Handlers

Create convention-based handler files in `.beads/`:

```typescript
// .beads/on.issue.created.ts
export default async ({ issue, beads }) => {
  console.log(`New issue: ${issue.title}`)
}
```

### Scheduled Handlers

Run workflows on a schedule:

```typescript
// .beads/every.hour.ts
export default async ({ issues, epics }) => {
  const stale = issues.filter(i => /* stale check */)
  // Process stale issues
}
```

### Execution Modes

- **Daemon**: Local watcher that reacts to file changes
- **GitHub Action**: CI/CD integration for push, schedule, and manual triggers
- **CLI**: One-off commands and retry capabilities
